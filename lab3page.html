      <h2>Tables, Forms, Tabbed Browsing, and Screen Reading</h2>
      <p>In this lab we were asked to design a page which included an accesibble form, and accessible table, google icons, and skip navigation. So I decided to make a page about my favorite soccer (football) club, Atl√©tico de Madrid.
          I implemented an about section which informed readers about what the club is, then I made an accessible table which included a list of the players with the most games for the club, and finally, I implemented and accessible form which users could fill out.
          In this lab we were also asked to check the accesibility of our website by using tools like WAVE, W3C validator, and html5 outliner.  
      </p>
      <p>
          It was very interesting to learn about accessible tables and forms because I can imagnie there being a lot of problems with these if they aren't made accessible. For example, if there is a table with very key information, it would not be good  if there are people that cant properly understand this information.
          I also liked learning how to do skip navigation, which gives users a drop down menu when using tab which allowes them to skip to the main content of the page.
