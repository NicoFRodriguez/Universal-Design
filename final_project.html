      <h2>What is Universal Design?</h2>
      <p>
        Universal Design is the design and composition of an environment so that it can be accessed, understood, and used to the greatest extent possible by all people regardless of their age, size, ability or disability.
        Universal Design is essential for millions of people in the world who suffer from dissabilities, and might not be able to interact with things like others do.

      <h2>History of Universal Design</h2>
      <p>
        Though it may seem hard to grasp these days, Universal Design was not always around. 
        It started with Ronald Mace, who advocated for accesible design in houses and eventually succesfully set accesible building standards in the United States. 
        The concept of Universal Design is credited to Ronald Mace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Around the time Ronald Mace was advocating for his new concept of Universal Design, the United States government started to pass legislation which supported people with disabilities.
        This includes things like: the Architectural Barriers Act (1968); Section 504 of The Rehabilitation Act of 1973; the Fair Housing Act Amendments (1988); and the Americans with Disabilities Act (1990).
        While these didnt completely solve the problem, it was a good starting point in establishing minimum requirements to protect people with disabilities from discrimination.

      <h2>7 Principles of Universal Design</h2>
      <p>
        In 1997, the Seven Principles of Universal Design were developed in North Carolina State University.

            <tr>
              <td>5. Tolerance for Error</td>
              <td>The design minimizes hazards and the adverse consequences of accidental or unintended actions.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>6. Low Physical Effort</td>

              <td>7. Size and Space for Approach and Use</td>
              <td>Appropriate size and space is provided for approach, reach, manipulation, and use regardless of user's body size, posture, or mobility.</td>
            </tr>

        These principles essentially serve to create more inclusive, user-friendly, and accommodating designs, fostering environments and products that benefit everyone, regardless of individual differences or capabilities.
