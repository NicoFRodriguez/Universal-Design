      <h2>Coding & Posting a Web Page - The Basics</h2>
      <p>In this lab we were asked to take any wikipedia page and make it accessible using the techniques we had learned in class up to that point.
          Some of these techniques include: html5 semantic structure, anchor links to different sections, auto centering wrapper, hiding elements visually but not for screenreaders (sr-ony), and an appropriate color scheme.
          We also checked the accesibility of our website by using tools like WAVE, W3C validator, and html5 outliner.
      </p>

        I liked this lab because it was pretty open ended while also being straightforward. We could choose our own topic to make a website about, and design it as we wish as long as we followed the accessible techniques we learned in class.
        The thing I enjoyed the most learning about was making the sr-only. I would have never implemented something like that on my own, but im sure so many people out there rely on things like that to be able to access the content on websites.
