      <h3>Project overview</h3>
      <p>
        My favorite project is called Local, which is a project I am working on with 4 other people.
        I am currently doing this in my capstone class, where we have to create a startup from a small idea and eventually turn it into an MVP (minimum viable product).
        Our idea is to make a website which involves peer to peer interactions between a local and a traveler. 
        On our website "hosts" will be able to make activity postings like for example: "night out in Madrid" or "unique food in bengali restaurant" and then our users will be able to choose the activity they want to participate in, and then meet up with the host.
        The class I am doing this in is called Entreprenurial Projects and it is a year long class which I started this fall.

      <h3>What we have done so far</h3>
      <h3>Elevator Pitch</h3>
      <p>
          One of the very first things was develop an elevator pitch that we would later present in class and receive feedback on.
          After working on it for a while, this is what we arrived at: <strong>Have you ever gone on vacation, where you wanted to experience life there as a local but had no connections? You can unlock the hidden magic of destinations with Local. Our peer to peer experience sharing platform connects local experts and travelers for unique and authentic experiences you will NOT find at a tour guide company. Unlike tour guide companies that focus on high traffic areas, we only offer experiences that a local would actually do. Travelers pay a small fee to join locals on activities they actually enjoy and be shown around the localâ€™s city.  For our hosts, Local is an opportunity to make some extra cash showing off your city and meet travelers from different cultures. For affordable and authentic experiences, let Local transform your next destination.</strong>

      <h4>Lean Canvas</h4>
      <p>
          One of the first things we did was make a Lean Canvas. 
          A Lean Canvas is a strategic management template used for developing new business models and documenting existing ones, so we did this fine tune our idea and arrive at the best theoretical product possible. 
          The Lean Canvas included various categories which we needeed to think about and fill out including: the problem, the solution, key metrics, unique value proposition, unfair advantage, channels, customer segments, cost structure, and revenue streams.
          We made a first draft and then presented it to the class. After presenting, we received feedback on things we can tweak to make it even better. We also gained more information by conducting empathy interviews.

      <h4>Empathy Interviews</h4>
      <p>
          After developing our lean canvas, we embarked into conducting empathy interviews. You conduct empathy interviews by asking potential customers open ended questions in order to gain some insight into your product, empathy interviews are a form of product research.
          We interviewed a wide range of people from different backgrounds and stages of life, the group of people we wanted to focus on however, were younger people who are willing to have a unique experience with starngers from other countries.
          Some of the questions we asked people included: Tell me about your recent travel experiences, How often do you go on vacation and what are  your favorite types of destinations?, Do you prefer organized tours or exploring on your own? etc...
          Not only did we ask our interviewees about being a user on our platform, we also wanted to gain insight into whether or not people were interested in being hosts, and showing people around their own city.

      <h4>MVP Prototype</h4>
      <p>
          Our final deliverable for this semester was a minimum viable product prototype. 
          A inimum viable product (MVP) prototype is a design of the different features that we wish to implement into our website.
          We used Figma to design what we hope our website will look like by the end of next semester. 
          The features we designed include: a log-in page for both hosts and travelers, edit profile pages for both hosts and travelers, the ability to post an experience, a main landing page where all activities can be viewed, and a more sepcific parameterized search page... etc
