      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>My name is Nicolas Rodriguez and I am a 4th year Computer Science student. I was born in Spain where I lived until I was 14 before moving to Colorado in 2016. I have lived here in Colorado ever since. I am very into sports, both watching and playing. I love to ski and play tennis, I also love to watch football (soccer) and the NBA. My favorite teams are Atl√©tico de Madrid and the Denver Nuggets.</p>
      <p>I love to travel, I have been to 4 continents including: North America, South America, Europe, and Africa. I also really enjoy food and trying different types of cuisine. Some of the more obscure things ive tried include: horse steak, fermented shark, ostrich eggs, and bull tail.</p>
