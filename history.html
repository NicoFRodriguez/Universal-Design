      <h2>Universal design benefits everyone</h2>
      <p>
        Now that we know what Universal Design is, why is it so important?
        Application of universal design principles minimizes the need for assistive technology, results in products compatible with assistive technology, and makes products more usable by everyone, not just people with disabilities.
        Typically, products are designed to be most suitable for the average user. In contrast, products that are designed according to principles of universal design are designed to be usable by everyone, to the greatest extent possible, without the need for adaptation or specialized design.

        This is a youtube video of a TED Talk given by Michael Neismith in Boulder.
        Michael is deaf and a native American Sign Language speaker working as a creative designer for Amazon.
         Throughout his career, Michael's visual/conceptual way of thinking and problem solving have served him both as an asset and a challenge. 
         He finds solutions around his disability through Universal Design.
         In the video, Michael talks about how "everyone has a disability" and that Universal Design techniques dont benefit just those with disabilities like him, but they benefit everybody.
         He gives a very compelling argument in favor of Universal Design, as well as supporting his arguments by giving some real life examples, like a movie script app for deaf people in movie theaters.

      <h2>Real world accessibility examples</h2>
      <h3>Low-floor Bus</h3>
      <p>
        Low-floor buses are buses that ride lower to the floor, as the name implies.
        The goal of these kind of buses is to get rid of stairs. 
        By getting rid of stairs, people that struggle to go up starirs can have a much easier time getting on one of these buses.
        The beauty however, is that this doesnt only benefit people who struggle to go up stairs, it makes it easier for everyone to get on the bus.
