      <h2>Accessible CSS Layout</h2>
      <p>
        In this lab we made a multicolumn webpage which included a header, nav bar, main, 2 asides, and a footer which was designed using css. We also used css grid areas and css flex-box to make the 2D layout and 1D nav unordered list of links respectively.
        Once again we made sure the page was accesible by using tools like WAVE, W3C validator, and html5 outliner. I made my webpage about Nikola Jokic, the center for the basketball team of Colorado, the Denver Nuggets. In the nav bar, I included some links which related to Jokic. In the asides I included a list of centers, and an image of Jokic while in the main I just included some general information about him.

          I liked implemeting this because it is a way of ensuring that the content can be viewed correctly no matter what the screen size is of the device viewing the website. It is also a great way to give your website a good structure, and make it look clean and tiddy.
