      <h2>Nikola Jokic</h2>
      <p>Nikola Jokić (born February 19, 1995, Sombor, Serbia), is a Serbian professional basketball player, considered one of the most versatile talents of his generation. Widely considered the best-passing centre in the sport’s history, Jokić won two National Basketball Association (NBA) Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (2021–22) and led the Denver Nuggets to the 2023 NBA title.</p>
      <p>Contrary to popular belief, Jokic does indeed like basketball. You can't be so good at something that you don't like. Notice that I didnt say love however, because Nikola only loves one thing in this world: His horses (and his family I guess).</p>
      <h2>The Joker</h2>
      <p>Nikola Jokic is also known as The Joker. The Denver Nuggets center has had this nickname for a couple of years and many fans and analysts use it frequently.</p>
      <p>The Denver Nuggets superstar is from Serbia, which is why his last name is somewhat unusual. It is pronounced as "yo-kitch" and some fans can't pronounce it correctly. However, they have no problems pronouncing his nickname, The Joker. Nikola Jokic's nickname originates from his last name, which is why it shares three letters with it. Not only is it easier to pronounce than Nikola's last name, but many basketball fans are familiar with another Joker, a DC villain.</p>
      <p>However, Jokic's nickname has nothing to do with the antivillain from DC Comics. It is simply a play on words and the nickname was given to Jokic by Mike Miller, his former teammate.</p>
